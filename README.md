This study (# xiaojiejie_convergence) investigates popular and party uses of xiaojiejie ‘little older
sister’, a familiar expression of fictive kinship reborn as a viral personal reference and
social address in China’s convergence culture. Analysis of the Target Group Index in
the Baidu search engine suggests xiaojiejie is gaining ground over its predecessor among
young Chinese. Trends analysis of its usage in WeChat public accounts showed that the
term has spread from popular media to state media, which employs the viral address to
drive clickbait and disguise propaganda. An online survey of young Chinese WeChat
users (N=330) on their perception of xiaojiejie headlines from WeChat public accounts
showed that respondents could not tell state media uses from popular uses, providing
perceptual evidence of the blurry boundaries between popular and state media uses of
the viral address. The findings demonstrate the reality of linguistic convergence driven
by participatory performance and its perceptual consequences in China’s convergence
culture.
